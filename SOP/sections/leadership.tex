The power of interaction design (\acr{IxD}) is the last key to form an elegant computer-supported collaboration. 
My co-working experiences with Prof. \textbf{Rung-Huei Liang} and 
designers from Dept. of Industrial and Commercial Design (\acr{ICD}) at Natl. Taiwan Univ. of Sci. and Tech (\acr{NTUST}). 
enabled me to weave the two different knowledge together. 
We worked on designing reminiscence-aiding tech. 
Participating the user study, I first-time realized each user has their own distinct needs, 
some of which are far from researchersâ€™ expectation. 
I was then recommended as the Program Chair in OpenHCI workshop 2013, 
the top student-organized workshop on HCI in Taiwan, 
I managed more than twenty graduate students across computer science, design, and communication to organize the event. 
After OpenHCI, several attendees formed their own research teams for further collaboration. 
I thus successfully accelerated the development of HCI community in Taiwan. 
With the experiences, I look forward to bringing the unlimited possibility of collaboration between engineers and designers.

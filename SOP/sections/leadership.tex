\noindent
Besides making breakthrough on research, I also devote myself to help the research community develope.
I have TAed ``Introduction to Computer Science'', an introductory course for CS freshman, 
and ``User-Oriented Innovative Design'', a cross-campus course for CS and design graduate students.
My passion and knowledge in HCI made me recommended as the program chair of \textit{OpenHCI Workshop '13},
leading 20 more graduate students across 3 campuses to organize the biggest national event for students in HCI in Taiwan. \\

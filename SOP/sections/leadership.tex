\noindent
I believe that an outstanding researcher is not only good at making breakthrough on research, 
but also devote herself to nourish the research community.
I have TAed ``Introduction to Computer Science'', an introductory course for CS freshman, 
and ``User-Oriented Innovative Design'', a cross-campus course for CS and design graduate students.
My passion and knowledge in HCI made me recommended as the program chair of \textit{OpenHCI Workshop '13},
leading 20 more graduate students across 3 campuses to organize the biggest event for HCI students in Taiwan. \\

In addition to conducting innovative research, 
an excellent HCI researcher should also devote himself to help the community develop.
My enthusiasm and knowledge in HCI made me be recommended as the program chair of \textit{OpenHCI Workshop '13},
managing 20 more graduate students across 3 universities to organize the national event for HCI starters.
After the workshop, several attendees formed their own teams for further cooperation on research or business. 
I am proud of my contribution to the growing of HCI communities in Taiwan. \\

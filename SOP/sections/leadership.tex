I believe that an outstanding academic is not only excellent at research, 
but also devote herself to serve and nourish the research community. 
I have TAed ``Introduction to Computer Science'', an introductory course for CS freshman, 
and ``User-Oriented Innovative Design'', an interdisciplinary course for CS and design graduate students. 
I also served as the program chair for OpenHCI Workshop '13 (http://www.openhci.com/2013), 
the biggest annual student-organized HCI event held in Taiwan. 
I have led more than 20 graduate students from more than three different universities to complete the work and deliver the event very successfully.

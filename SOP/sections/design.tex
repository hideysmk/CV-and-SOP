\noindent
Professor Rung-Huei Liang introduced me to Interaction Design (\acr{IxD}).
Our IxD project on designing reminiscence-aiding devices were accepted as posters in \textit{DIS '12} and \textit{CHI '13}, 
and full paper in \textit{IASDR '13}.
I enjoy weaving my knowledge of CS and psychology together to develop user-friendly interaction 
and making contribution to the field of HCI and design research.\\

%I was then recommended as the Program Chair in OpenHCI workshop 2013, 
%the top student-organized workshop on HCI in Taiwan, 
%I managed more than twenty graduate students across computer science, design, and communication to organize the event. 
%After OpenHCI, several attendees formed their own research teams for further collaboration. 
%I thus successfully accelerated the development of HCI community in Taiwan. 
%With the experiences, 
%I look forward to bringing the unlimited possibility of collaboration between engineers and designers.\\

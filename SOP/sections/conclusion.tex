\noindent
I have long been wondering if cultural difference has anything to do with the state of the art of social computing. 
As an Asian student, it is my inherent responsibility to bridge the cross-cultural gap. 
Thus, 
an environment with high interdisciplinary and multi-cultural composition is necessary for me to earn cross-domain knowledge of computer science and social science. 
PhD in TSB emphasizes the insights from diverse domain. 
Your cross-domain collaboration and resources can best nourish my research on Social Computing.

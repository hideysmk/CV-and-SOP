%I long for enhancing our gifted ability and need: social interaction. 
%Under the big topic, I am also interested in several research domains. 
%Tangible User Interface and Information Visualization provide different forms for people to receive and send information. 
%With qualified research skill and solid basis of knowledge of computer science, design, and psychology, 
%I believe that SOME PROGRAM at SOME SCHOOL is the best interdisciplinary environment for me.

My ultimate ambition is to become a professor to nourish social computing research in Taiwan.
Ideas like \textit{Spirit Bomb} are hardly found in Western comics, which might present Eastern's collectivism.
Similarly, I have long been wondered if cultural difference has anything to do with the state of the art of social computing. 
As an Asian, it is my inherent responsibility to bridge the gap.
Thus, an environment with high interdisciplinary and multi-culture is necessary
for me to earn cross-domain knowledge of computer science, design, and psychology.
SOME PROGRAM at SOME SCHOOL emphasizes the insights from diverse domain. 
Your cross-domain collaboration and resources can best nourish my research on \textbf{Social Computing}.\\

My ultimate ambition is to become a researcher VISION HERE
I have long been wondering if cultural difference has anything to do with the state of the art of social computing. 
As an Asian, it is my inherent responsibility to bridge the gap.
Thus, an environment with high interdisciplinary and multi-culture is necessary
for me to earn cross-domain knowledge of computer science, design, and psychology.
SOME PROGRAM at SOME SCHOOL emphasizes the insights from diverse domain. 
Your cross-domain collaboration and resources can best nourish my research on \textit{Social Computing}.

I long for enhancing our gifted ability and need: social interaction. 
Under the big topic, I am also interested in several research domains. 
Tangible User Interface and Information Visualization provide different forms for people to receive and send information. 
With qualified research skill and solid basis of knowledge of computer science, design, and psychology, 
I believe that SOME PROGRAM at SOME SCHOOL is the best interdisciplinary environment for me.

%\noindent As a computer science student, I asked myself: 
%``can technology mediate communication by enhancing expression and perception of social behaviors?''
%Thanks to my high social ability, I can communicate with the autistic kid in the end. 
%However, not everyone has such high social ability. 
%Similar problematic communication do not only exist in special groups, but also in our daily lives. 
%It deteriorates our relationship, health, and working performance. 
%Nowadays, computers exist around us. 
%They can detect the tiny change from human and send messages in a cross-modal form, 
%helping us better perceive and express the social interaction status. 
%With enhanced perception and expression, people can adapt their behaviors accordingly. 
%A benign cycle of communication between human, computers, and human can therefore be formed. 
%To conduct the research, 
%I need a highly interdisciplinary environment to provide cross-domain knowledge of computer science, design, and psychology. 
%SOME PROGRAM at SOME SCHOOL emphasizes the insights from diverse domain. 
%Your cross-domain collaboration and resources can best nourish my research on CSCW and Social Computing.

Previous works of Human Computation have explored crowd power to a broad extent.
However, the relations between workers and relations between worker have still rarely been discussed.

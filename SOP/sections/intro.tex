\noindent 
My motivation of pursuing \textbf{PhD in Human-Computer Interaction (\acr{HCI})}
has much to do with \textit{Weekly Sh\={o}nen Jump}, a Japanese comic magazine with the slogan: ``Friendship, Practice, and Victory''.
My childhood was occupied by those impressive frindship scenes, especially the advanture comic \textit{Dragon Ball}.
I was fascinated with the idea of \textit{Spirit Bomb}, 
the strongest attack by collecting people's power in \textit{Dragon Ball}.
Although everyone has his/her own limitation, once the power is integrated, 
the resulted energy can go beyond the sum of individual.
In reality, countless problems are intractable with a limited amount of experts,
but when carefully decomposed into small pieces, billions of hands can come to help solving the problem, 
just as the \textit{Spirit Bomb}.
The idea of utilizing crowd power ignites my passion of \textbf{Social Computing},
or to be more specifically, \textbf{Computer-Mediated Communication (\acr{CMC})} and \textbf{Human Computation}. \\

\noindent My motivation of pursuing \textbf{PhD in Human-Computer Interaction (\acr{HCI})}
has much to do with \textit{Weekly Sh\={o}nen Jump}, a Japanese comic magazine with the slogan: ``Friendship, Practice, and Victory''.
My childhood was occupied by those impressive frindship scenes in \textit{Sh\={o}nen Jump}, especially the advanture comic \textit{Dragon Ball}.
I was totally fascinated with the idea of \textit{Spirit Bomb}, 
the strongest attack by collecting people's wills and power in \textit{Dragon Ball}.
Although everyone has his/her own limitation, once the power is integrated, 
the resulted power can go far beyond the sum of each individual's power.
As a computer science researcher, I aim to create a \textit{Spirit Bomb} for those complicated problems in our life,
so I start doing research on \textbf{Human Computation} and \textbf{Computer-Mediated Communication (\acr{CMC})}. \\

\noindent 
My interest in \textit{Social Computing} was led by my multi-cultural family.
Born in a traditional Taiwanese big family,
I am educated lean by my grandparents who received Japanese education.
After my aunt married an Irish man, 
communication and culture gap hence become routines in our daily life, 
even impacting on our relationships and work performance.
For example,
it is always painful for my family to set up telecommunication to contact \\

\noindent
I asked myself:``can technology mediate communication by enhancing perception and expression of social behaviors?''
In this era of flat world, people from different countries can communicate and work together via latest technology.
I believe that Social Computing, 
especially \textit{Computer-Mediated Communication} (\acr{CMC}), \textit{Cross-culture Online Interaction}, and \textit{Crowdsourcing},
will remain important research topics in Human-Computer Interaction (\acr{HCI}) in the near future.
I want to develop technologies mediating human social interaction by enhancing perception and expression of social behaviors.
Ultimately, I aim to conduct innovative research in academy after pursuing Ph.D.\\
